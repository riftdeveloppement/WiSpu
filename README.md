# 🌐 Wispy Wi-Fi Hotspot Manager 🚀

Welcome to **Wispy**, your go-to solution for creating and managing Wi-Fi hotspots, monitoring connected devices in real-time, and logging device information automatically.

## Features ✨

- 🛠️ **Deploy Wi-Fi Hotspot**: Easily set up a Wi-Fi network with just one click.
- 🖥️ **Monitor Connected Devices**: Detect and log new devices as they connect to your network.
- 📂 **Auto File Creation**: Automatically generate `.txt` files for each connected device, including their IP, device name, and other details.
- 🔒 **Admin Privileges Required**: Automatically requests admin rights when needed.
- 🔍 **Clean Log Output**: See real-time logs of device connections in the command prompt.

## How it Works ⚙️

When you launch the **Wispy Hotspot Manager**, you can deploy a Wi-Fi hotspot and monitor all devices connecting to your network. The program will create a `.txt` file in the `dist/` folder for each new device that connects to your Wi-Fi, using the device’s name as the filename and logging relevant information.

## Installation 💻

Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x). You’ll also need admin privileges for this to work.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wispy-wifi-manager.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd wispy-wifi-manager
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage 🛠️

To launch the **Wispy Wi-Fi Hotspot Manager**, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal with admin privileges (required to manage networks).
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Scripts 📜

#### Start Hotspot 🛰️

To deploy the Wi-Fi hotspot with the default SSID (`WISPY`) and password (`wispy12345`):

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
- Set up the Wi-Fi network: **WISPY (password: wispy12345)**.
- Display a confirmation message that the hotspot is active.
- Automatically start the device monitoring in the background (`viewer.py`).

#### Stop Hotspot 🛑

When you’re ready to stop the Wi-Fi hotspot, simply select the stop option within the program:

```bash
# Follow the on-screen instructions to stop the hotspot.
```

This will:
- Stop the Wi-Fi network.
- Remove the saved profile from your system.

#### Monitor Devices 🔍

The device monitoring happens automatically once the hotspot is deployed. However, you can manually run `viewer.py` if you want to just monitor the network:

```bash
python viewer.py
```

The script will display real-time logs of newly connected devices in the command prompt and generate `.txt` files with the device's name, IP address, and more.

## Example Output 📝

After a device connects, you’ll see this kind of output in the terminal:

```
Viewer.py is running, monitoring new devices...
New device detected:
Device Name: MyPhone
IP Address: 192.168.1.10
File created: dist/MyPhone.txt
```

And the corresponding `.txt` file will contain:

```
Device Name: MyPhone
IP Address: 192.168.1.10
Email: john.doe@example.com
First Name: John
Last Name: Doe
Phone Number: 123-456-7890
```
